<h1>Hidden Vendor Security Advisories</h1>
<p>
This repo contains a list of vendors that hide their security advisories, alerts, notices, vulnerabilities, and more behind either a paywall or a login experience.
<p>
<p>
This practice does not aid anyone except the vendor. Vendors do this to either farm lead generation or to obfuscate their security issues.
<p>
This type of communication should no longer exist.

<h3><b>Vendors: do better, be better.</b></h3>

<h1>Your Part</h2>
<p>
Your part in this endeavor can be to help promote to vendors the value of openly sharing security related information. If you utilize these products in your environment, please aid by bringing it up to them and voicing your concerns that in order to find security related information, you must login or maintain another account to access this data.
<p>
In a world around identity, it's not best practice to have so many accounts on so many platforms. Information is meant to be free.
